# Better than Rain!

An ambiance mod for **Better than Adventure!** (a b1.7.3 fork) that makes subtle adjustments to the rain experience. Currently it adds unique dynamic sounds to different blocks when raining, and soon *slightly* more realistic rain visuals! (just audio for now)

This mod aims to improve the rain atmosphere while keeping the vanilla feel alive, especially for beta versions.

*Inspired by [Cool Rain by Jaiz](https://modrinth.com/mod/coolrain) for later versions*
